## Overview

### The challenge

- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard #FAILED MISERABLY
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

-- HTML first
-- style using scss
-- then write functionality using plain js

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Normalize CSS

### What I learned

I rarely deal with form so this is my first time doing such thing like form validation. Also created my own functionality

### Continued development

I can reuse this layout for future project, most of my code can be further enhance and optimized
